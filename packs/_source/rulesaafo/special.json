A high Strength increases your hit  and damage with melee weapons and unarmed attacks.  It’s also a great scare tactic against anyone. But most  importantly, Strength measures your ability to handle any  weapon and carry your equipment across the wasteland.  All weapons have a Strength requirement, and if you fail to  meet it you’ll have disadvantage to all your attack rolls with  the weapon. If you have a low Strength, opt for lighter  weapons. Having a low Strength will also significantly  reduce your Carry Load, but a high one will allow you to  carry lots of stuff.</p>"

If you do  not have enough action points to spend on an action, you  do not perform the action. You have a number of action  points equal to 10 + your Agility modifier. You can only  ever have a maximum of 15 action points. You regain all  your spent action points at the start of each of your turns.
